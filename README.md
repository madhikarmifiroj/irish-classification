# irish-classification
This project uses Machine Learning to classify iris flowers into three species:<br>  Iris Setosa<br>  Iris Versicolor <br>Iris Virginica
The model is trained using the classic Iris dataset, which contains measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
The goal is to build a simple yet effective classification model and visualize insights from the dataset.
